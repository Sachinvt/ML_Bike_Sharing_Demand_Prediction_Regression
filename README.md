# Project Summary -
**BUSINESS PROBLEM OVERVIEW**-
Urban cities are experiencing an increasing need for efficient and sustainable transportation solutions to address traffic congestion and environmental concerns. In this context, rental bikes have gained significant popularity as a cost-effective and eco-friendly mode of transportation. These bike-sharing systems provide city residents and tourists with a convenient and accessible means of commuting.

However, ensuring a stable supply of rental bikes is a complex challenge. The success of a bike-sharing system relies on predicting the demand accurately at various hours and locations, to ensure that bikes are available when and where needed. This problem statement aims to address the task of predicting bike-sharing demand, which plays a crucial role in maintaining an efficient and reliable bike-sharing system

# Datasets:

The dataset you described contains information related to bike sharing and includes various attributes:

**Date:** The date in a year-month-day format.

***Rented_Bike_Count:** *The number of bikes rented at each hour. This is the target variable you might want to predict.

**Hour:** The hour of the day, indicating the time at which the bike rentals are recorded.

**Temperature:** The temperature in Celsius at the given time.

**Humidity:** The humidity level expressed as a percentage.

**Windspeed:** The wind speed in meters per second (m/s).

**Visibility:** The visibility in meters (typically given as 10 meters).

**Dew Point Temperature:** The temperature at which air becomes saturated and dew forms, typically in Celsius.

**Solar Radiation:** Solar radiation measured in MJ/m2 (MegaJoules per square meter).

**Rainfall:** The amount of rainfall in millimeters (mm).

**Snowfall:** The amount of snowfall in centimeters (cm).

**Seasons:** A categorical variable indicating the season at the given date and time, such as Winter, Spring, Summer, or Autumn.

**Holiday:** A categorical variable indicating whether it's a holiday or not (Holiday/No holiday).

**Functional Day:** A categorical variable indicating whether it's a functional day (Functional hours) or a non-functional day (Non-Functional Hours).

Basically this dataset consist of 8760 rows and 14 columns. It also having no any duplicate or missing values. Out of 14 variables there are 4 categorical features and remaining are numerical features.
